# e-banking

The project will be implemented as a client-server protocol to mimic transactions/ebanking between an ATM (client) and the bank (server). Also, we will enable banking operations to deposit, withdraw money, and check balance via ATM by accessing the bank.

The goal is to
(i) negotiate and establish a secure channel using the SSL/SSH handshake protocol.
(ii) pass back and forth messages to implement the banking operations above.
